# Hangwoman2.0
This game is a spin off of 'Hangman' with just a different name but the same conecpt.
A word will be chosen at random from the work bank in a text document. 
You are given 8 chances to guess the word by guessing one letter at a time.
## Why?
Hangman was one of my favorite games as a kid and I thought it would be a interesting concept for me to try to do in python
coding.
