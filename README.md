# Hangwoman2.0
This game is a spin off of 'Hangman' with just a different name but the same conecpt.
A word will be chosen at random from the work bank in a text document. 
You are given 10 chances to guess the word by guessing one letter at a time.
## Don't cheat!
Make sure you ONLY input a single character (not multiple letters or 0 letters), only letters A-Z
or else you will get an ERROR message! 
## Why?
Hangman was one of my favorite games as a kid and I thought it would be a interesting concept for me to try to do in python
coding.
